#What to do first
If you are installing Umbraco locally, we strongly recommend you use the Microsoft Web Platform Installer (webPI) to install Umbraco.  The Web Platform Installer is a free tool from Microsoft that handles much of the complexity of determining the compatibility of your system with Umbraco.  [Get the Web Platform Installer here](http://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx)

Go to the [Web Platform Installer step-by-step section](WebPI-step-by-step.md) to get started.

If you have decided to use a web host that has installed Umbraco for you, you have even less to do.  The web host will send you instructions detailing how to connect and login to your Umbraco site once the installation is complete.

If you’ve already installed Umbraco and you want to know what’s next, skip ahead to the Understanding Umbraco - A Primer section below.
